I'm excited to share one of my latest projects: BookStore, developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). ðŸ’¡ Key Features:

Book Management: Easily create, edit, and delete books.
Data Verification: Each book includes details like author, title, publication year, and a unique ID.
Customizable View: Choose between a grid/table view or a card view for an enhanced user experience.
ðŸ”§ Technical Details:

Frontend: React for a responsive and intuitive UI.
Backend: Node.js and Express.js for robust server management.
Database: MongoDB for efficient data handling.
I worked to make everything simple and intuitive while ensuring that the data is accurate and well-structured.
